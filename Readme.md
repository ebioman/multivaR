# Multivariable Logistic regression test

I came recently along this nice [tutorial on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIR9zN0tDPw) which I found very well
explained and had some great examples.

This is essentially just a repo following that code + some additional tests and playing around.
The report is [here](MultiVar.md) and is generated with the code and the container which is in a VScode dev container format in this repo, too.
